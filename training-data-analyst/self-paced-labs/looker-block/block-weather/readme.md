Looker has created this block to make analyzing data easier and more efficient. This Data Block is made available on an "as is" basis, meaning there will not be updates moving forward. Looker can not represent or warrant that this data will be accurate, reliable, or error-free. Please consult the documented data source sites for details on how their data is being collected and how to interpret it.

#  Weather Data Block

#### Customization/Extension ####
- This block uses refinements for customization. For more information on using refinements to customize marketplace blocks, please see [this link](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/marketplace/customize-blocks#marketplace_blocks_that_use_refinements).
- Refinements can be used to add new content or modify existing content on views and explores without the need to copy individual LookML elements into a new project.
